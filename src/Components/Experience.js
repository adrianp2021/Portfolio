            A 12-week full-time bootcamp designed for a career transformation in
            tech where I learnt the fundamental skills to build Full- Stack web
            applications. Throughout the bootcamp, I also learned to work
            through the agile method, work in a team, have daily stand-ups,
            refine and plan our projects.
